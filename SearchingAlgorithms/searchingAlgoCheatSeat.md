Linear Search Algorithm : 
    Known as sequantial algorithm
    traverse a list or array 


if array is sorted : - YES 
    - time complexity not a problem - linear search 
    - small data set - yes : Linear search 
                     - No  : Binary search 
    - search in linked List - go for linear search 

                   : NO 
    -
